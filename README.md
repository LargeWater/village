# VILLAGE

## A text-based browser game.

## Much more functionality to come
- Images to represent houses
- more resources like food etc.
- gathering and building will take time
- hunger
- random events (i.e. attacks that kill villagers, destroy houses, eat food, etc.)

## Heavily inspired by [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), but ultimately going a *very* different route.
